# About

A repository of examples and inspiration for extending the users toolbox when writing unittests.

While the examples are written in Python, the concepts are applicable to any language that supports unit testing.

For people that are more into Python, some examples are implemented with both Pythons built in `unittest` framework as well as the third party `pytest` framework to show the differences and similarities between the two.

All examples are built using MkDocs and can be found [here](https://chargestorm.github.io/unittest-learning/).
